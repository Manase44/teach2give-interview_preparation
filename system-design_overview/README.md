# System Design
System design is the process of defining the architecture, models, and components of a system in order to meet specific user requirements while considering factors like scalability, aintainability, and perfomance.  
## Importance of System Design
- Gives a clear understanding of the user functional and non-functional requirements and how exactly to achieve them.  

- Provide a platform for making fundamental decisions for the project, such as deciding whether to go with SQL or NoSQL database.  

- System design enhances the quality of a system by ensuring it is scalable and can accomodate traffic increase.  

- It provides the structural layout of how the system's components will be designed, for example, how many servers will be installed and where. 

- It enhances the efficiency of the system by ensuring that the architecture and models of the system are optmized.


## Essential Design Methods in System Design
There are various method and techniques used to design the system architecture, and they include:  

1. **Architectural design** - This method describes the structure, model, components, and interaction of the entire system.
2. **ERD diagrams** - Entity relationship diagrams are used to design the applications database structure; define schemas, system entities, attributes, and the relationship betwen entities. 

3. **UML diagrams** - Unified modeling language is a collection of various system modeling techniques used to represent various aspects of the system.

4. **Class diagrams** - It describes the system's data and functionality by representing the classes, class attributes, class methods, and the relationship between multiple classes.  

5. **Sequence diagrams** - This method models the beahvior of the system by representing the interactions between various components in the system.

## Fundamental Concepts of System Design 

1. ### Performance and scalability
      
      __Performance__ is the speed and efficiency at which a system can execute a task. Caching is one of the many mechanisms to ensure high performance of a system.  

      __Scalability__ is the ability of a system to accormodate changes and growth in traffic. Distributing loads among several servers is one method of guaranteeing scalability of a system.


2. ### Latency and throughput
  
      __Latency__ is the time taken for data to be transmitted from one point to another in a system.  It is measured in miliseconds. It is affected by network structure, geographics distance, and the transport protocol.

      __Throughput__ is the number of operations a system can handle in a given time. It is emasured in megabytes per second. Scaling up the server can increase the system's throughput.
3. ### Consistency patterns and availability patterns
